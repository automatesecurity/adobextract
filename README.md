A quick and simple script to extract interesting information from the Adobe leak.  To add a new search parameter, just add a new domain (TLD; no http or www) to the domains.txt file.  Make sure the extracted cred file from users.tar.gz is in the same directory as the adobextract.sh and domains.txt file.

Usage: ./adobextract.sh
